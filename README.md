# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns #

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in determining the ideal funding request and launch date for her play’s Kickstarter Campaign. We gathered data from Kickstarter itself that included: categories and subcategories, amounts of funding requested, amounts of funding received, whether the campaign was fully funded or not and when each campaign began and ended.

# Process and Recommendations #
The first step was to filter the data down to look only at plays. This was then cross referenced with the amount of money requested by each play campaign and whether it was successful.

As shown in in the chart titled “Outcomes Based on Goal”, play projects that requested $1000 to $4999 were the most successful at 73%. The $1000 to $4999 category was also the second largest at a total of 534 campaigns. Projects in the $35000 to $39999 and $40000 to $44999 category were technically tied for second in percentage of success (both 67%) however because there were only 4 total projects in the $35000 to $39999 category and three in the $40000 to $44999 category, it is not wise to advise Louise to consider these higher funding categories.

Moving on to outcomes by launch date, we can see that the most successful projects were launched in the month of May, with a downward trend for the rest of the calendar year (June – December). Thus, we would advise Louise to strongly consider launching her campaign in the spring, ideally between the latter part of April and the early part of June.

# Limitations and considerations #

We would be wise to advise Louise to be aware that our data is all historical in nature and does not consider social and economic factors that may impact future behavior of donors. We may want to look further into markers of economic success by year and see if there is a relationship between the economic climate and the Kickstarter donations received. For the United States, the Gross Domestic Product, the unemployment rate and changes in the Federal Reserve Interest rate would all be metrics of economic success that could be cross referenced with our existing data.
