# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns #

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in determining the ideal funding request and launch date for her play’s Kickstarter Campaign. We gathered data from Kickstarter itself that included: categories and subcategories, amounts of funding requested, amounts of funding received, whether the campaign was fully funded or not and when each campaign began and ended.

# Process and Recommendations #
The first step was to filter the data down to look only at plays. This was then cross referenced with the amount of money requested by each play campaign and whether it was successful.

As shown in in the chart titled “Outcomes Based on Goal”, play projects that requested $1000 to $4999 were the most successful at 73%. The $1000 to $4999 category was also the second largest at a total of 534 campaigns. Projects in the $35000 to $39999 and $40000 to $44999 category were technically tied for second in percentage of success (both 67%) however because there were only 4 total projects in the $35000 to $39999 category and three in the $40000 to $44999 category, it is not wise to advise Louise to consider these higher funding categories.
